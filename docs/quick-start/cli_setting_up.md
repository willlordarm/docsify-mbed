<h1 id="cli-setup">Installing Mbed CLI 1</h1>

The setup process for Arm Mbed CLI depends on your operating system. We recommend using our installers, but have also provided links to manual installation instructions.

| Windows | macOS | Linux |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Download and run the [Windows installer for Mbed CLI](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli-windows-installer/releases/latest). | Download and run the [macOS installer for Mbed CLI](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli-osx-installer/releases/latest). | Please follow the [manual installation instructions for Linux](../build-tools/install-and-set-up.html). We currently do not provide an installer for Linux. |

<span class="notes">**Note:** We recommend the installers above for less experienced developers and those using the GNU Arm embedded toolchain (`GCC_ARM`). For Linux users, please install Mbed CLI manually. Advanced Windows and macOS users can also install Mbed CLI manually. If you want to compile using the Arm Compiler or a different version of the GNU Arm embedded toolchain, visit the [supported compilers page to see which versions you can use](../build-tools/index.html#compiler-versions).</span>
