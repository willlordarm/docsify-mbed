# Example walkthrough

The quick start example blinks the LED on your board on and off. The main thread also takes a snapshot of the device's runtime statistics and displays them over a serial connection to your PC.

## Viewing the output

To view the serial output use any terminal client, such as [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) or [CoolTerm](http://freeware.the-meiers.org/).

The default baud rate, or speed, for this application is set to `9600`. You can modify it in the `mbed_app.json` file. To configure your terminal client to this baud rate, change the speed option when selecting the port.

The output transmits the system, CPU, heap and thread information.

<span class="notes">**Note:** If you are building with the Mbed OS bare metal profile, you will not get thread information.</span>

## Understanding the output

### System information

**Mbed OS version:** Tip of master is represented by 999999. If you are using a tagged release of Mbed OS, the version will be configured by the OS. For custom releases, you can modify the version manually in `platform/mbed_version.h`.

**CPUID register information:**

**Compiler ID and version:**

| Compiler | Version tag | Version layout |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| ARM      | 1           | PVVbbbb (P = Major; VV = Minor; bbbb = build number) |
| GCC_ARM  | 2           | VVRRPP  (VV = Version; RR = Revision; PP = Patch)    |


### CPU statistics

Percentage of runtime the device has spent awake.

### Heap statistics

- Current heap size.
- Maximum size the heap has ever reached (*not* the maximum size it can reach).

### Thread statistics

Provides information on all running threads in the OS:

- ID.
- Name.
- State.
- Priority.
- Stack size.
- Stack space.
