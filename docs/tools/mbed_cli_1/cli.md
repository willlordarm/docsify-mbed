<h1 id="mbed-cli">Overview</h1>

Many experienced developers prefer to work offline. To meet this need, Arm provides Arm Mbed CLI 1, a command-line tool packaged as `mbed-cli` and based on Python.

Mbed CLI 1 enables Git- and Mercurial-based version control, dependencies management, code publishing, support for remotely hosted repositories (GitHub, GitLab and mbed.org), use of the Arm Mbed OS build system, export functions and other operations.

## Feedback

We're keen to learn about your experience with Mbed CLI on other operating systems at the [Mbed CLI development page](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli).
