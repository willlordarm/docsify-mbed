# USB device stack

## Introduction

A functional Mbed OS USB device consists an implementation of USBPhy, the USBDevice stack and a USB component code:

- USBPhy provides raw access to USB in the role of a USB Device.
- USBDevice is the core of Mbed OS's USB stack and is responsible for state management and synchronization.
- USB component is code that inherits from USBDevice and provides the desired USB interfaces.

You can see the interaction of these three components in this diagram:

## Synchronization

The class **USBDevice** is interrupt-safe. It uses a critical section to provide thread- and interrupt-safe locking. USB components inheriting from USBDevice can use this lock, but it is not required.

The recommended model for synchronizing a USB component is to wrap code requiring synchronization in a call to `USBDevice::lock` and `USBDevice::unlock`. Functions or callbacks already synchronized by a caller at a higher level should document this locking requirement by calling `USBDevice::assert_locked` in the first line of the function or callback.

Code requiring locking:

```c TODO
void USBComponent::do_something()
{
    lock();

    // Do do something

    unlock();
}
```

Code that expects a caller at a higher level to hold the lock:

```c TODO
void USBComponent::do_something_internal()
{
    assert_locked();

    // Do do something
}
```

## USB device state

USB defines five separate states of a device: **Attached**, **Powered**, **Default**, **Address** and **Configured**. Each state adds functionality. The **Attached** state has the least functionality, and the **Configured** state has the most functionality.

| State      | Functionality                            |
|:----------:|:----------------------------------------:|
| Attached   |    Power events                          |
| Powered    |    Reset events                          |
| Default    |    Control endpoint 0 active             |
| Address    |    No new functionality                  |
| Configured |    All enabled endpoints are functional  |

Random power loss can cause the USB device to lose functionality. When leaving or outside of the Configured state, USBDevice ignores writes to and reads from all endpoints other than endpoint 0.

## USB component callbacks

All callbacks USBDevice sends to its children are prefixed with `callback_*`. USBDevice calls these callbacks with the USB lock held. One notable callback is `callback_state_change`, which USB components can use generically to handle leaving the Configured state. The USB stack automatically exits the Configured state on disconnect, power loss or USB reset.

### Control request state machine

There are four callbacks that the USB control state machine sends. When USBDevice calls these callbacks, the USB component must return a result to continue the control state machine. The USB component does not need to return the result immediately, which gives it time to process the request. **Note that the USB component must always send the response, regardless of any USB device state changes.**

Table of control callbacks and the required response:

| Callback                                          | Response                                 |
|:-------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
| callback_request(setup_packet)                    | complete_request(result, data, size)     |
| callback_request_xfer_done(setup_packet, aborted) | complete_request_xfer_done(result)       |
| callback_set_configuration(configuration)         | complete_set_configuration(result)       |
| callback_set_interface(interface, alternate)      | complete_set_interface(result)           |

<span class="images">![](usb-arch-pics/usb_control_state_diagram_user.png)</span>

The USB stack guarantees the setup packet passed to `callback_request` and `callback_request_xfer_done` remains valid and unchanged up to the point the USB component completes the request with `complete_request` and `complete_request_xfer_done`. Additionally, when the USB component calls `complete_request` with the value `Receive` or `Send`, the USB stack guarantees that `callback_request_xfer_done` is called. If the USB component calls `complete_request` with a buffer and size, that buffer must remain valid and unchanged until USBDevice calls the function `callback_request_xfer_done`.

## IN and OUT state machine for endpoints

A USB component adds and removes endpoints as part of `callback_set_configuration` and `callback_set_interface` to set up the corresponding interface or configuration. Additionally, USBDevice automatically removes all added endpoints if the device leaves the Configured state.

When a USB component adds an endpoint, you can either write to it with `write` or read from it by calling `read_start` and `read_finish`. The buffers passed to `write` or `read_start` must remain unchanged until the operation is complete, indicated by USBDevice calling the endpoint callback, or you abort the operation with `endpoint_abort`. Note that for `write`, the buffer size must not exceed the maximum packet size for the given endpoint. For `read_start`, the buffer must be at least the maximum packet size.

Below is a diagram showing the typical state machine for read (OUT) and write (IN) transfers.

## Endpoint configuration

To ensure a USB component runs on all supported devices, the USB component must select the configuration descriptor's endpoints based on the current device. This is because endpoint number and endpoint functionality can differ by device. A USB component can determine the features of USBPhy by examining its endpoint table.

To simplify the process of selecting endpoints, use the **EndpointResolver** class. A USB component constructs the class with an endpoint table. The USB component can then call the class to find an endpoint of the given type and size. After the component finds all required endpoints, it can call the function `EndpointResolver::valid()` to determine whether this device supports this configuration. Below is an example of this:

```c++ TODO
EndpointResolver resolver(endpoint_table());
resolver.endpoint_ctrl(CDC_MAX_PACKET_SIZE);
bulk_in = resolver.endpoint_in(USB_EP_TYPE_BULK, CDC_MAX_PACKET_SIZE);
bulk_out = resolver.endpoint_out(USB_EP_TYPE_BULK, CDC_MAX_PACKET_SIZE);
int_in = resolver.endpoint_in(USB_EP_TYPE_INT, CDC_MAX_PACKET_SIZE);
MBED_ASSERT(resolver.valid());
```
