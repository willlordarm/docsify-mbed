# Using PSA-enabled Mbed TLS

## Building PSA-enabled Mbed TLS from Git

The version of Mbed TLS shipped in Mbed OS builds with PSA enabled by default. However, you can build a PSA-enabled version of Mbed TLS from [our Git repository](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls):

1. Clone the repository and switch to the `master` branch.
1. Enable the `MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO` build-time configuration option in `include/mbedtls/config.h`, either by editing the file manually, or using the config script: `scripts/config.py set MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO`.
1. Build normally, for example (with GNU Make) `make lib` or (with CMake) `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make lib`.

## Using PSA-enabled Mbed TLS

You can use PSA and non-PSA Mbed TLS interchangeably, but you must recompile your application every time you change. This is because PSA-enabled and non-PSA-enabled Mbed TLS are fully API compatible, but are not ABI compatible. <!-- All existing (pre-PSA) APIs are preserved and continue to exist in parallel with PSA-based APIs.-->

_Please note that this is likely to change at a later date though, as existing interfaces are likely to be deprecated in favor of the new, PSA-based APIs - if, when and how it happens is outside the scope of this document._

## PSA-based APIs in Mbed TLS

As mentioned in the previous section, you can use PSA-neabled Mbed TLS to build applications that are not PSA enabled. Doing so is enough to benefit from PSA in some areas (for example, some PSA-based hardware acceleration, depending on platform support), but in other areas, changes in the application source code are necessary. This mainly means replacing calls to pre-PSA APIs with calls to their PSA-based versions.

The new APIs allow using PSA-managed keys for a few purposes, such as TLS client authentication, CSR generation and TLS PSK connections. Letting the key be managed by PSA is good for security because PSA can isolate the keys from the rest of the applications (referred to below as "opaque keys"). To use such PSA-managed keys, you need to modify your code to use the new APIs as described below.

## Using opaque ECDSA keys for TLS client authentication

This mainly involves using the new API function `mbedtls_pk_setup_opaque()` to wrap a PSA-managed key into a PK context, then using that context with the usual TLS APIs.

### Application flow without PSA

1. At application startup, make sure `mbedtls_platform_setup()` is called if relevant.
1. Declare (and allocate) an object of type `mbedtls_pk_context`.
1. Load a key into that PK context, presumably using `mbedtls_pk_parse_key()` (or `mbedtls_pk_parse_keyfile()`).
1. Configure the key for use in client authentication with a matching certificate by calling `mbedtls_ssl_conf_own_cert()` on the PK context.
1. Use the resulting SSL configuration for TLS connections as usual.
1. When you're done using TLS connections based on that configuration, _and no longer want to use that key for anything else_, free the PK context using `mbedtls_pk_free()`.

### Application flow with PSA

1. At application startup, make sure `mbedtls_platform_setup()` is called if relevant, and make sure `psa_crypto_init()` is called, too.
1. Declare (and allocate) an object of type `mbedtls_pk_context` *and an object of type `psa_key_handle_t`*.
1. Allocate and load the key you want to use through the handle object. (For information on how to do this, please refer to the PSA Crypto documentation.)
1. Set up the PK context to wrap that handle by calling `mbedtls_pk_setup_opaque()`.
1. Configure the key for use in client authentication with a matching certificate by calling `mbedtls_ssl_conf_own_cert()` on the PK context.
1. Use the resulting SSL configuration for TLS connections as usual.
1. When you're done using TLS connections based on that configuration, free the PK context using `mbedtls_pk_free()`. This only frees the PK context itself and leaves the key handle untouched. You can either keep using the key handle or call `psa_destroy_key()` on it depending on your application flow.

## Using opaque ECDSA keys to generate certificate signing requests (CSRs)

This mainly involves using the API function `mbedtls_pk_setup_opaque()` to wrap a PSA-managed key into a PK context, then using that context with the usual TLS APIs.

### Application flow without PSA

1. At application startup, make sure `mbedtls_platform_setup()` is called if relevant.
1. Declare (and allocate) an object of type `mbedtls_pk_context`
1. Load a key into that PK context, presumably using `mbedtls_pk_parse_key()`, or by generating a fresh key.
1. Configure the pending CSR object to use that key by calling `mbedtls_x509write_csr_set_key()` on that PK context.
1. Call any other function you need to configure and generate the CSR.
1. When you're done generating the CSR, _and no longer want to use that key for anything else_, free the PK context using `mbedtls_pk_free()`.

### Application flow with PSA

1. At application startup, make sure `mbedtls_platform_setup()` is called if relevant, and make sure `psa_crypto_init()` is called, too.
1. Declare (and allocate) an object of type `mbedtls_pk_context` and an object of type *`psa_key_handle_t`*.
1. Allocate and load the key you want to use through the *handle* object. (For information about how to do this, please refer to the PSA Crypto documentation.)
1. Set up the PK context to wrap that handle by calling `mbedtls_pk_setup_opaque()`.
1. Configure the pending CSR object to use that key by calling `mbedtls_x509write_csr_set_key()` on that PK context.
1. Call any other function that you need to configure and generate the CSR.
1. When you're done generating the CSR, free the PK context using `mbedtls_pk_free()`. This only frees the PK context itself and leaves the key *handle* untouched. You can either keep using the key *handle* or call `psa_destroy_key()` on it, depending on your application flow.

## Using opaque pre-shared keys with TLS PSK ciphersuites

This mainly involves using the API function `mbedtls_ssl_conf_psk_opaque()` in place of `mbedtls_ssl_conf_psk()` client-side or, server-side using `mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_psk_opaque()` instead of `mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_psk()` in the PSK callback.

### Application flow without PSA

1. At application startup, make sure `mbedtls_platform_setup()` is called if relevant.
1. Set up an `unsigned char *` to point to a memory area holding your pre-shared key.
1. Call `mbedtls_ssl_conf_psk()` on the SSL configuration object.
1. Use that configuration object in TLS connections.

### Application flow with PSA

1. At application startup, make sure `mbedtls_platform_setup()` is called if relevant, and make sure `psa_crypto_init()` is called, too.
1. Set up a *`psa_key_handle_t`* to point to a configured slot holding your pre-shared key.
1. Call `mbedtls_ssl_conf_psk_opaque()` on the SSL configuration object.
1. Use that configuration object in TLS connections.
