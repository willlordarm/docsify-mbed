<h1 id="mac-port">Porting IEEE 802.15.4 MAC driver</h1>

Nanostack has a lower-level API for the IEEE 802.15.4-2006 MAC standard. This enables developers to support different MACs for software- and hardware-based solutions. Nanostack offers SW MAC, which you can use when your board does not have 15.4 MAC available. SW MAC also supports a subset of IEEE 802.15.4-2015 MAC standard. Supported features are:

- IEEE 802.15.4-2015 enhanced ack.
- Header and payload information elements set by MAC user.

## SW MAC

Nanostack includes an IEEE 802.15.4-based SW MAC class. You can use SW MAC when your board does not support MAC. To use the SW MAC service, you must have a working RF driver registered to Nanostack. To create SW MAC, call the following function:

```
ns_sw_mac_create()
```

This creates an SW MAC class and sets a callback function to be used by Nanostack.

<span class="notes">**Note:** You must not call `ns_sw_mac_create()` more than once.</span>

### SW MAC IEEE 802.15.4-2015 subset extension

SW MAC supports a subset of the IEEE 802.15.4-2015 standard. The subset includes the following supported features:

- Data frame send with payload and header information elements defined by MAC user.
- Enhanced ACK generation and send by MAC.
- Enhanced ACK payload and Information elements write for MAC user.

The subset features need a proper supported RF driver with extended driver API commands.

## Initializing SW MAC

Deploy SW MAC:

1. Call `arm_net_phy_register()` to register the configured RF driver class to Nanostack.
1. Call `ns_sw_mac_create()` to create SW MAC with needed list sizes:

    - A sleepy device needs only 1-4 as the size of the `device_decription_table_size`.
    - The recommended value for `key_lookup_size` is 1 and for `key_usage_size` 3.

1. Call `arm_nwk_interface_lowpan_init()` to create Nanostack with the created SW MAC class. Nanostack initializes SW MAC before using it.

## Example

This code snippet creates SW MAC with a neighbor table of size 16 and three key descriptions:

```
int8_t generate_6lowpan_interface(int8_t rf_phy_device_register_id)
{
    mac_description_storage_size_t storage_sizes;
    storage_sizes.device_decription_table_size = 16;
    storage_sizes.key_description_table_size = 3;
    storage_sizes.key_lookup_size = 1;
    storage_sizes.key_usage_size = 3;
    mac_api_t *mac_api = ns_sw_mac_create(rf_phy_device_register_id, &storage_sizes);
    if (!mac_api) {
        tr_error("Mac create fail!");
        return -1;
    }
    return arm_nwk_interface_lowpan_init(mac_api, "6LoWPAN_ROUTER");
}
```

## Enabling FHSS

SW MAC supports FHSS. To enable it, you need to do the following:

1. Call `arm_net_phy_register()` to register the configured RF driver class to Nanostack.
1. Call `ns_sw_mac_create()` to create SW MAC with needed list sizes.
1. Call `ns_fhss_create()` to configure and define the FHSS class.
1. Call `ns_sw_mac_fhss_register()` to register FHSS to SW MAC.
1. Call `arm_nwk_interface_lowpan_init()` to create Nanostack with the created SW MAC class.

## IEEE 802.15.4 MAC sublayer APIs

The stack uses the IEEE 802.15.4 defined MAC management service entity (MLME-SAP) and MAC data service (MCPS-SAP) interfaces. MAC API follows MCPS and MLME primitives defined by the IEEE 802.15.4-2006 standard.

The following primitives are used in MAC layer:

| Primitive | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Request | Request made by service user. |
| Confirm | MAC layer response to earlier request. |
| Indication | Indication event from MAC to service user. |
| Response | Service user's response to received indication. |

The following header files define the MAC API:

- `mac_api.h` - Main header, which defines a transparent MAC API for Nanostack to use.
- `mlme.h` - Definitions for MLME-SAP primitives.
- `mac_mcps.h` - Definitions for MCPS-SAP primitives.
- `mac_common_defines.h` - Definitions for common MAC constants.

## MCPS-SAP interface

MCPS-SAP defines 802.15.4 data flow API with the following primitives:

| Primitive | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `MCPS-DATA-REQ` | Data request primitive to MAC. |
| `MCPS-DATA-CONF` | MAC generated confirmation for ongoing `MCPS-DATA-REQ`. |
| `MCPS-DATA-IND` | MAC generated data indication event. |
| `MCPS-PURGE-REQ` | Cancel ongoing `MCPS-DATA-REQ` from MAC. |
| `MCPS-PURGE-CONF` | Confirmation from MAC to `MCPS-PURGE-REQ` operation. |

## MLME-SAP interface

MLME-SAP defines a set of different management primitives, and this document introduces both supported and unsupported primitives in Nanostack.

### Supported MLME APIs

MLME-SAP primitives used by Nanostack:

| Primitive | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |

## MAC API class introduction

This chapter introduces MAC mesh interface `mac_api_s`. It is a structure that defines the function callbacks needed by a service user.

The base class defines the functions for two-way communications between an external MAC and service user. The application creates a `mac_api_s` object by calling the MAC adapter's create function. The newly created object is then passed to Nanostack, which initializes its own callback functions by calling the `mac_api_initialize()` function. A service user operates MAC by calling MLME or MCPS primitive functions.

The MAC API class structure `mac_api_t` is defined as:

```
typedef struct mac_api_s {
    //Service user defined initialization function which is called when Nanostack takes MAC into use
    mac_api_initialize              *mac_initialize;
    mac_api_enable_mcps_ext     *mac_mcps_extension_enable;
    //MAC adapter function callbacks for MLME & MCPS SAP
    mlme_request                    *mlme_req;
    mcps_data_request               *mcps_data_req;
    mcps_data_request_ext       *mcps_data_req_ext;
    mcps_purge_request                  *mcps_purge_req;
    //Service user defined function callbacks
    mcps_data_confirm               *data_conf_cb;
    mcps_data_confirm_ext       *data_conf_ext_cb;
    mcps_data_indication                *data_ind_cb;
    mcps_data_indication_ext    *data_ind_ext_cb;
    mcps_ack_data_req_ext       *enhanced_ack_data_req_cb;
    mcps_purge_confirm                  *purge_conf_cb;
    mlme_confirm                        *mlme_conf_cb;
    mlme_indication                     *mlme_ind_cb;
    //MAC extension API for service user
    mac_ext_mac64_address_set           *mac64_set;
    mac_ext_mac64_address_get           *mac64_get;
    mac_storage_decription_sizes_get *mac_storage_sizes_get;
    int8_t                              parent_id;
    uint16_t                            phyMTU;
};
```

## MAC API standard extensions

This section introduces MAC API standard extensions.

### MAC 64-bit address set and get

Nanostack uses 64-bit address set and get. There are two 64-bit addresses available:

- NVM EUI64.
- Dynamic 64-bit address used at the link layer.

Address set and get support two different 64-bit addresses:

| Address enumeration type | Description |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| `MAC_EXTENDED_READ_ONLY` | A unique EUI64. |
| `MAC_EXTENDED_DYNAMIC` | Dynamic 64-bit address. Same as EUI64 after boot. |

### MAC maximum storage information get

Usually, HW MAC and SW MAC have static keys and neighbor list sizes. Nanostack always asks the maximum size to limit its neighbor table size. The service user must define the `mac_storage_sizes_get()` function returning the following values:

- MAC device description list size (must be > 1).
- MAC key description list size (must be > 1).

### MLME attribute extension

Nanostack uses MLME attribute extensions, which you must port to the HW MAC adapter. To configure the extensions, use the `MLME-SET-REQ` command.

| Enumeration type | Value | Description |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `macAcceptByPassUnknowDevice` | `0xfc` | Accept data through MAC if the group key and MIC can authenticate the packet data. Security enforcement point must carefully handle these packets. |
| `macLoadBalancingBeaconTx` | `0xfd` | Trigger to MAC layer to send a beacon. Called by the load balancer module periodically. |
| `macLoadBalancingAcceptAnyBeacon` | `0xfe` | Configure MAC layer to accept beacons from other networks. Enabled by load balancer, default value is `False`. Value size boolean, `true=enable`, `false=disable`. |

## HW MAC

To use HW MAC, you need to create an adapter class that links function calls between Nanostack and HW MAC. To create the adapter class, implement the functions defined in the `mac_api_s` structure. When HW MAC generates an event, the adapter must handle it and do a parameter adaptation before calling the correct function from the `mac_api_s` structure. You may need the same parameter adaptation for requests from Nanostack to HW MAC.

<span class="notes">**Note:** Function calls from Nanostack to HW MAC must be nonblocking in the adapter layer.</span>
