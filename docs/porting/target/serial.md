<h1 id="serial-port">Serial</h1>

Implement the API declared in `mbed-os/hal/serial_api.h`. You must define the `serial_t` struct in `objects.h`. You may use the `serial_t` struct for referencing memory-mapped serial registers and passing related pin and peripheral operation information data that the HAL needs.
