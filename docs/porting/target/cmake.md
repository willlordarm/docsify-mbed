# CMake target porting

See below instructions to add support for Mbed targets to build with CMake using mbed-tools.

Important variables provided for Mbed target:

- `MBED_TARGET_LABELS`: a list of labels added to a given Mbed target coming from the Mbed target default configuration file `targets.json`.
- `MBED_TARGET_DEFINITIONS`: a list of macro definitions added to a given Mbed target coming from the Mbed target default configuration file `targets.json`.

- `MBED_CONFIG_DEFINITIONS`: a list of macro definitions added to a given Mbed target coming from various Mbed library configuration files.
- `MBED_TARGET_SUPPORTED_C_LIBS`: a list of C library types supported by a given Mbed target coming from the Mbed target default configuration file `targets.json`.
- `MBED_TARGET_SUPPORTED_APPLICATION_PROFILES` a list of application profiles supported by a given Mbed target coming from the Mbed target default configuration file `targets.json`.

Note: All the CMake variables above are generated by mbed-tools and their values can be overridden using an application configuration file (mbed_app.json) in the same manner.

## Mbed targets CMake input file structure

As we are still supporting Mbed CLI 1, we have maintained the directory naming scheme that use prefixes (`FEATURE_`, `COMPONENT_`, `TARGET_`).

Every Mbed CMake target should be prefixed with `mbed-`. Mbed boards listed in `targets.json` are translated in CMake to add the prefix and replace `_` with `-`. For example, the Mbed board `CYSBSYSKIT_01` is represented by the CMake target `mbed-cysbsyskit-01`.

### Vendor selection

Vendor selection is handled in [`targets/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/targets/CMakeLists.txt). A subdirectory is added to the build if one of the CMake targets it contains is referenced.
e.g

```
add_subdirectory(TARGET_Cypress EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
```

### MCU family targets

`targets/TARGET_<VENDOR_NAME>` usually contains different MCU or Mbed target families. The structure of the vendor directory is up to the vendor but it is preferable that it has logical separations.
For example, the content of `targets/TARGET_Cypress/TARGET_PSOC6` can be listed as follows:

```
add_subdirectory(COMPONENT_SCL EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)


add_subdirectory(COMPONENT_WHD EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
add_subdirectory(common/COMPONENT_WHD EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

add_subdirectory(TARGET_CY8CKIT064B0S2_4343W EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
add_subdirectory(TARGET_CY8CKIT_062S2_43012 EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
...

add_library(mbed-psoc6 INTERFACE)

# Add the include directories accessible from this directory that are specific to this MCU family or Mbed target
target_include_directories(mbed-psoc6
    INTERFACE
        ...
)

# Add the source files accessible from this directory that are specific to this MCU family or Mbed target
target_sources(mbed-psoc6
    INTERFACE
        ...
)
```

The board CMake targets should link to `mbed-psoc6`:

```
add_library(mbed-cysbsyskit-01 INTERFACE)

target_include_directories(mbed-cysbsyskit-01
    INTERFACE
        ...
)

target_sources(mbed-cysbsyskit-01
    INTERFACE
        ...
)
# Other libraries that the Mbed board depends on
target_link_libraries(mbed-cysbsyskit-01
    INTERFACE
        mbed-cat1a
        mbed-cysbsyskit-01-cm4
        mbed-cysbsyskit-01-bsp-design-modus
        mbed-psoc6
        mbed-cy-psoc6-scl
)

target_compile_definitions(mbed-cysbsyskit-01
    INTERFACE
        "CY8C624AFNI_S2D43F"
)

mbed_post_build_psoc6_merge_hex("CYSBSYSKIT_01")
```

## Add Mbed board CMake input source file

Add `CMakeLists.txt` files to the top level directory of a given vendor directory. List all files found in the directory in this CMake input source file, adding additional CMake input source file if it is MCU or Mbed target specific and has a great number of files which will make the top level `CMakeLists.txt` too complex. Think when you decide to create functions in a computer software code to remove complexity.

See [`targets/TARGET_Cypress/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/targets/TARGET_Cypress/CMakeLists.txt) for examples.

### Add your sources and includes

A whole directory can be added to the build using `add_subdirectory()` if it is specific to an MCU family (or Mbed target) and has a complex structure containing more directories and files. Otherwise simply list the files contained in the directory.
See an example below:

```
add_subdirectory(TARGET_<VENDOR_MCU_VARIANT> EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

target_include_directories(mbed-<vendor-mcu-variant>
    INTERFACE
        .
        subdirectory
)

target_sources(mbed-<vendor-mcu-variant>
    INTERFACE
        file1.c

        subdirectory/file2.c
)
```

Sources are listed using CMake's `target_sources()` function and added to the `mbed-core` CMake target as shown above. Header files are not explicitly listed, the directory where they can be found is listed instead. This is also shown above.


### Linker script file

A function `mbed_set_linker_script` must be invoked for each linker file. The linker file must be listed with its absolute path, this is achieved by adding the sub-path obtained by the CMake variable `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}`.
e.g

``` 
add_library(mbed-cysbsyskit-01-cm4 INTERFACE)

if(${MBED_TOOLCHAIN} STREQUAL "ARM")
    set(LINKER_FILE_CM4 device/COMPONENT_CM4/TOOLCHAIN_ARM/cy8c6xxa_cm4_dual.sct)
    set(STARTUP_FILE_CM4 device/COMPONENT_CM4/TOOLCHAIN_ARM/startup_psoc6_02_cm4.S)
elseif(${MBED_TOOLCHAIN} STREQUAL "GCC_ARM")
    set(LINKER_FILE_CM4 device/COMPONENT_CM4/TOOLCHAIN_GCC_ARM/cy8c6xxa_cm4_dual.ld)
    set(STARTUP_FILE_CM4 device/COMPONENT_CM4/TOOLCHAIN_GCC_ARM/startup_psoc6_02_cm4.S)
endif()

target_sources(mbed-cysbsyskit-01-cm4
    INTERFACE
        device/COMPONENT_CM4/system_psoc6_cm4.c
        ${STARTUP_FILE_CM4}
)

mbed_set_linker_script(mbed-cysbsyskit-01-cm4 ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/${LINKER_FILE_CM4})
```

#### ARMClang linker file

The shebang in the ARM toolchain linker file, also known as scatter file, needs to update the interpreter program from `armcc` to `armclang` and pass it different optional arguments.
Replace `armcc -E` with `#! armclang -E --target=arm-arm-none-eabi -x c -mcpu=<CORE_TYPE_FLAG>` where <CORE_TYPE_FLAG> is the MCU core type for a given Mbed target. Once you have determined which MCU core your Mbed target is based on, head to [tools/cmake/cores/](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/tree/master/tools/cmake/cores) and open the CMake module your Mbed target is based on and look what the `-mcpu` is set to.

### Adding pre-compiled target libraries

Pre-compiled libraries and object files are listed using CMake's `target_link_libraries()` function with an absolute path of the file added.
e.g

```
target_link_libraries(mbed-cysbsyskit-01-cm4
    INTERFACE
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/libprecompiled.ar
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/file_object.o
)
```
