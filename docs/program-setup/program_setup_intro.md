# Introduction

When writing an Mbed OS program, you may need to:

* Set up a serial connection to your board so you can flash and debug your program.
* Select or create a build profile to pass flags to the compiler when building your programs.
* Use build rules to include or exclude files and directories from your build.
* Use the configuration system to define how your board uses features and the bootloader.
* Modify or set up a new target.
