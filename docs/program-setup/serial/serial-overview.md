# Serial communication overview

Communicating with your development board is an essential part of programming and debugging. [Terminal applications](../program-setup/serial-communication.html#using-terminal-applications) make this communication easier. Using terminal applications is often the second step of debugging after blinking lights, and it can give you more information than flashing lights can.

This tutorial teaches how to install a serial driver, troubleshoot and use terminal applications to facilitate board to PC communication over USB. Once you have completed this tutorial, you will be able to use terminal applications to echo back characters as you type, pass characters in both directions and use stdin, stdout and stderr, as well as read to a buffer.
