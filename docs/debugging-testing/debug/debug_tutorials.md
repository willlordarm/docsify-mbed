# Debugging Applications

A benefit of Arm Mbed OS applications is the ease with which you can debug them. You can use any IDE that supports GDB to debug Mbed OS applications. Three such IDEs that you can use to debug are Eclipse, Keil uVision and Visual Studio Code.

This section covers debugging with these three IDEs. By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to install, export a project to and start a debugging section in each of these programs. At the end of the section, you will learn how to analyze and investigate bugs from our step-by-step instructions, which use the example of debugging the BBC micro:bit with pyOCD and GDB.
